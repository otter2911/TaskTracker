# TaskTracker
A Clear, Easy and Fun way to keep track of tasks and assignments and complete them in fun ways for rewards to help with motivation

## Inspiration
Task lists and to-do lists can often be overwhelming and being indecisive about what task to complete can often mean nothing gets done

These lists frequently get forgotten or lost either being physical on paper or on a notes app

I want to design a system that can be in the corner of your screen motivating you to complete tasks and making decisions for you when you are being indecisive so that you can stay productive

I also want the system to encourage rewards and breaks to maintain a healthy lifestyle and improve your mental attitude towards disliked tasks.

## Aims
Create a method of keeping track of tasks and things to do being able to easily add, remove and alter them

 Use a Reward system that will randomly allocate a reward to the user when they are productive and motivate them to continue with their work

Devise a way of randomising the tasks to present the user with one to help with indecision and improve overall productivity

Implement a fun game to help motivate the user to complete the tasks they have set

## What it does
The project has 4 main functionalities

To-Do List:
Presents the user with a scrolling to-do list from which they can add and remove tasks to keep track of what they need to do. There is also the ability to highlight tasks to aid the user's organisation as these marks can mean what they like to the user 

Reward's list:
Presents the user with a similar scrolling list but this time of a variety of rewards they can use as motivation. The user can add and remove items from the list creating a list of reward ideas fr when they complete a task

Randomiser:
The randomiser screen consists of a spinning random wheel which when clicked spins and displays a random task for the user to complete from their list. This can help with indecision and the fun graphic is a motivation to use the feature 

Bingo Board:
The bingo board displays the tasks the user has entered in a 4x4 grid and the user is able to click on the squares to mark them or un-mark them. when the user has achieved a 'Bingo' (achieved a line or filled in the whole grid) they can press the reward button which will generate a pop up displaying a random reward

## How I built it
I built it in python using the library pygame for the UI. I also used an app called sketchbook to design the logo and other art

## Challenges I ran into
I wasn't too familiar with pygame so i had to learn how the library worked and the best way to implement all the features i planned.

The main challenge i ran into was time. I have never had to develop anything in this time span so had to be measured about my expectations and ability.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am extremely proud that i was able to produce a working solution with all the features i planned within the time limit.

## What I learned
I learnt more about my own capabilities and skills as well as gained new knowledge of the pygame libarary
I also learnt that AI isn't the best at generating code!!

## What's next for TaskTracker
I hope to add some form of storage system that enables the user to store the tasks, rewards and any bingo board progress so that they do not loose it when the application is closed
